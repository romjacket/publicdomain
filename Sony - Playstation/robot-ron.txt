Robot Ron OPM
=============

...if you play def-en-der rack a bigger hy-per-space, so!...


gameplay
--------

Robot Ron (the silver thing) has to blast the enemies (green/blue/orange
things) and collect powerups (pink things) to try and increase his "score".
Thats it.


controls
--------

Robot Ron is playable with the digital pad but a Dual Shock (analog) is
recommended for the full fun experience

diigtal mode:

- You use the D-pad to move Ron about
- You use Cross, Triangle, Square and Circle to fire in the corresponding
  direction at stuff

analog mode:

- You use the left stick to move Ron about
- You use the right stick to point and fire at stuff


gameplay hints
--------------

- the spawning lasers can't hurt you, but it's best to try and stay away from 
them because thats where the enemies come from

- keeping your shots trained on the spawners is a great idea if you have enough 
spare bullets

- hiding in the corner can get you through some levels, but not others

- hanging about with one enemy left to try and get more powerups won't work, but 
it will let you have a bit or a rest before the next stage

The original "chrimble blasting fun" version was completed in 3 days. The OPM
changes were added on few sunny afternoons in August.

This is most probably the last version of Robot Ron, bigger and better things 
and all that.
